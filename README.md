# Thesearemydotfiles

Hey! I'm Bengt Bennink and welcome to my dotfiles. 

## What have I done?!
 
In my .bashrc I made additions to make my terminal life a little more fun.
Most of them are small things like little emoij's or some shortcodes.

## Installation & Setup

First I created an account on this amazing platform Github. Then I created my first repository to store my files in. Then followed these 'Octocat' steps in my terminal:

* cd /Users/bengtbennink/Desktop/CMD/TECH/thesearemydotfiles **to locate my local repository**

* git clone https://github.com/bengtbennink/thesearemydotfiles.git  **to connect to my github repository**

* git status **to check if everything is fine so far**

* nano README.md **So I can fill in this beautifull README**

* git add README.md **To put README.md in staging areau**

* git status **cant be sure enough**

* git commit -m "first test commit" **To see if things are working**
